                                          target="_blank">Sofia</a>. Its population is 14 500 people. It is situated on
                                    a narrow and rocky peninsula. It’s founded during the 5th century BC. Pomorie is an
                                    ancient town, well known with its old name Anhialo. Anhialo has been a colony of the
                                    antique town Apolonia (present-day Sozopol), and it’s been destroyed and restored
                                    many times. Even then the salt extraction and the wine production have been
                                    developed. Pomorie was famous with its mud-curing lagoon. During 13-14 centuries the
                                    town was a big harbor, whereof wool, wheat, beeswax, honey and wine was exported
                                    abroad. During the Ottoman rule the town has retained its importance of a big
                                    coastal center. In 1906, a conflagration nearly destroyed the old town, except the
                                    few antique houses on the east part. In 1899-1900, in the town has lived and worked
                                    the famous Bulgarian poet Peyo Yavorov. Here he has written his best works. There is
                                    a monument of him near the sea coast, at the place he used to relax.</p>
                                <p>Today Pomorie is one of the most beautiful sea towns. The coastal line is wide and
                                    covered with fine sand, at some places nearly black. Our coastal line has the
                                    ecological reward “Blue Flag”. The beautiful houses and all the private hotels give
                                    an opportunity of valuable vacation. The coastal avenues are favorite place for
                                    walks and rest of the tourists.</p>
                                <p>Pomorie is well known as a center for health tourism, because of the sanatorium, that
                                    is operating all around the year. There the mud from the Pomorie Lake, rich in
                                    iodine and minerals, is used for treatment of rheumatic and neural troubles. </p>
                                <p>The production of red and white wines, as well as vermouths, special brandies and
                                    cognacs, has gained recognition and distinction at popular international
                                    competitions and exhibitions. </p>
                                <p>The traditional Days of Yavorov, taking place in Pomorie, are famous event in the
                                    summer. Very interesting and memorable places for our tourists are: the Monastery
                                    “St. George” from 1856; the Orthodox Churches “Christ”, “The Transfiguration of
                                    Christ”, and “Virgin Mary.” Near the Camping site “Europe” was opened a beehive
                                    tomb. Its height is 8 m. and its diameter is 60 m. It originates from 3th century,
                                    and it’s an original combination between a typical, Thracian beehive tomb and a
                                    Roman mausoleum. It is interesting for its construction, as it consists of a tunnel
                                    leading to round camera. The beehive tomb is open to visitors.</p>
                                <p>There is a regular bus line to and from the town. </p>

                            <p>At 4 km. on the west of Pomorie is situated an unique dump tomb, originated from the
                                beginning of IV century A.C.</p>
                            <p>This place was called a necropolis - the town of the death. The tomb was found in 1888,
                                and it represents an ingenious old outfit, unique on the Balkan Peninsula. In 1959, the
                                Beehive tomb was renovated and open for visitors. It is recognized as a National
                                Monument of Bulgarian Culture, and receives lots of guests and experts from Europe, USA
                                and Japan. </p>
                            <p>According its tectonic elaboration, the tomb represents a combination between the
                                Thracian custom of burial under a mound, and the burial in a mausoleum to the custom of
                                the Romans. </p>
                            <p>The furrow on the stony threshold at the entrance of the dromos, formed through the
                                continuous door opening and closing, leads the experts to the conclusion that this is
                                not just a regular tomb, but a mausoleum wherein religious ceremonies have been
                                constantly performed. </p>
                            <p>There was found a sarcophagus into another necropolis, 10 m. away from the tomb. Around
                                the Antique Dump Tomb there have been raised up lots of mounds, where the
                                representatives of the high Anhialo – Thracian aristocracy have been buried. </p>

                                sanctified in 1765. It was built on the emplacement of a smaller temple that had existed
                                since IX century and destroyed in 1760.</p>
                            <p>The church"s massive rectangular building is composed of three naves with wooden
                                ceilings. There are no external domes and interior arches. The altar apse to the east is
                                missing and covered by a two hip roof. Two windows - to the north and south. Two gates -
                                the southern one bigger than the western one. The church is built entirely of

                            <p>The inside is decorated with icons and wood carved iconostasis with floral motives. The
                                fretwork is of very high artiastic and technical level. 17 large icons of the king"s row
                                by different icon painters from XVII and XVIII century are placed on the iconostasis.
                                Some icons originate even from the XVI century. On the second apostolic row there are 33
                                small icons - apostolis, festal and saints. Under the king"s icon of Jesus Christ, in
                                the foundations, there is a small holy spring with holy water, appearing from a stone
                                slab of 20-25cm thichness. The spring was named by the Christians "Tears of Jesus". </p>
                            <p>The original architectural design of the church missing altar apse to the east, and the
                                rich interior decoration makes it unique for the whole Christian world. In 1972 the
                                church has been explored and listed as an original monument of fine art, and in 1976 has
                                been reckognized as Monument of culture of national significance.</p>

                                older iconostasis, the icons are copies of Russian icons.</p>
                            <p>In 1959 the Church was wholly renovated. The mural paintings have been made by the
                                artists N.Rostovtsev, K.Jordanov and A.Sorokin in the spirit of classical iconography.
                                The iconostasis was changed with a fretwork made by K.Kosharevski. </p>

                            <p>A group of archeologists have found remains from an ancient temple dedicated to the cult
                                of Izida, in the area called “Paleocastro” in Pomorie. The temple dates as far back as
                                in the middle of second century AD. </p>
                            <p>The cult had imbued in the Balkans along the west coast of the Black Sea during the rule
                                time of Alexsander Makedonski’s heirs. There are famous monuments from that time – from
                                Tomis (present day Constantsa), and Mesembria (present day Nessebar). </p>
                            <p>Sarapis was considered a conqueror, according to Sergei Torbatov, the director of
                                excavations. Recently the archeologists have found an old building, claiming that this
                                is a part from the Temple of Izida and Sarapis.</p>
                            <p>Among the ruins there were found coins and things considered to have magical power by the
                                ancient people. According to the archeologists the Temple of the Egyptian goddess was
                                built upon another, older sanctuary of the Thracian pagan gods. This still needs to be
                                investigated. </p>
